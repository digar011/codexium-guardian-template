## Example Reviews:

### Good Example:
**Severity:** warn

**Summary:** Checkout flow has 3 major friction points that likely cause 30-40% cart abandonment.

**Conversion Issues:**
- Forcing account creation before checkout (30% abandonment trigger)
- Shipping costs hidden until final step (60% abandonment trigger)
- No guest checkout option
- Payment options limited (no Apple Pay/Google Pay)
- Mobile checkout has 8 form fields (high friction)

**CTA Problems:**
- "Submit Order" button is generic (weak CTA)
- Primary CTA same color as secondary actions
- CTA below fold on mobile
- No urgency or reassurance

**Friction Points:**
- Password requirements too strict (12+ chars, symbols) - users give up
- No progress indicator (users don't know how many steps)
- Can't edit cart from checkout (must go back)
- CAPTCHA on every step (excessive friction)
- No autofill for address fields

**Optimization Recommendations:**

1. **Add guest checkout (HIGH IMPACT):**
   ```jsx
   <div className="checkout-options">
     <button className="primary">
       Continue as Guest
     </button>
     <button className="secondary">
       Sign In
     </button>
   </div>
   ```
   Expected impact: +15-25% conversion

2. **Show total cost upfront:**
   ```jsx
   <CartSummary>
     <Line>Subtotal: $99.00</Line>
     <Line>Shipping: $12.00</Line>
     <Line>Tax: $8.50</Line>
     <Total>Total: $119.50</Total>
   </CartSummary>
   ```
   Expected impact: +10-15% conversion

3. **Improve CTA:**
   ```jsx
   // BAD:
   <button>Submit Order</button>
   
   // GOOD:
   <button className="cta-primary">
     Complete Purchase - $119.50
     <span className="trust">🔒 Secure Checkout</span>
   </button>
   ```
   Expected impact: +5-8% click-through

4. **Add payment options:**
   ```jsx
   <PaymentMethods>
     <ApplePay />
     <GooglePay />
     <CreditCard />
     <PayPal />
   </PaymentMethods>
   ```
   Expected impact: +10-15% mobile conversion

5. **Simplify mobile:**
   ```jsx
   // Use address autocomplete
   <AddressAutocomplete />
   
   // Reduce fields (combine first/last name)
   <Input name="fullName" label="Full Name" />
   
   // Smart defaults
   <CountrySelect defaultValue={userCountry} />
   ```
   Expected impact: +20-30% mobile completion

6. **Add progress indicator:**
   ```jsx
   <Steps current={2}>
     <Step>Cart</Step>
     <Step>Shipping</Step>
     <Step>Payment</Step>
   </Steps>
   ```
   Expected impact: +5-10% completion

**A/B Test Suggestions:**
- Test "Continue as Guest" vs "Quick Checkout"
- Test showing/hiding total cost on first step
- Test button colors (green vs orange)
- Test shipping estimates vs exact costs
- Test one-page vs multi-step checkout

**Metrics to Track:**
- Cart abandonment rate (current: ~68%, target: <50%)
- Checkout completion rate
- Time to complete checkout
- Mobile vs desktop conversion
- Drop-off points in funnel

**Positive Notes:**

### Critical Example:
**Severity:** critical

**Summary:** Pricing page dark patterns and misleading CTAs violate FTC guidelines - legal risk.

**Conversion Issues:**
- Deceptive design patterns (dark UX)
- Hidden subscription terms
- Misleading "free trial" CTA
- No clear way to cancel
- Bait-and-switch pricing

**CTA Problems:**
- CTA says "Start Free Trial" but actually starts paid subscription
- Cancel button hidden and grey (hard to see)
- "Accept" button for unwanted upsells pre-checked
- Confirm subscription button says "Continue" (unclear)

**Friction Points:**
- Can't see total cost before entering payment
- Subscription auto-renews without clear notice
- No reminder before charging
- Cancellation requires phone call (dark pattern)

**FTC Violations:**
- **15 U.S.C. § 45:** Deceptive practices
  - Free trial requires credit card and auto-converts to paid
  - Not disclosed until after card entered
  
- **ROSCA (Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act):**
  - No clear disclosure of subscription terms
  - No easy cancellation method
  - Pre-checked boxes for additional services

**Required Actions (LEGAL COMPLIANCE):**

1. **Clear subscription disclosure:**
   ```jsx
   <SubscriptionTerms prominent>
     Your free trial lasts 14 days. After that, you'll be charged 
     $29/month until you cancel. Cancel anytime with one click.
     
     <button onClick={showCancellation}>
       See how to cancel
     </button>
   </SubscriptionTerms>
   ```

2. **Honest CTAs:**
   ```jsx
   // BAD (misleading):
   <button>Start Free Trial</button>
   
   // GOOD (transparent):
   <button>
     Start 14-Day Free Trial
     <small>Then $29/month, cancel anytime</small>
   </button>
   ```

3. **Easy cancellation:**
   ```jsx
   // Must be as easy as subscribing
   <button onClick={cancelSubscription}>
     Cancel Subscription
   </button>
   
   // No phone call, no email, no hoops
   ```

4. **Remove dark patterns:**
   ```jsx
   // NO pre-checked upsells
   <Checkbox checked={false}>
     Add premium support ($10/mo)
   </Checkbox>
   
   // NO hidden decline buttons
   <button className="decline-visible">
     No thanks
   </button>
   ```

5. **Renewal reminders:**
   ```javascript
   // Email 7 days before renewal
   scheduleEmail({
     to: user.email,
     template: 'renewal-reminder',
     sendAt: renewalDate.minus({ days: 7 }),
     content: 'Your subscription renews in 7 days for $29'
   });
   ```

**Legal Liability:**
- **FTC fines:** Up to $43,792 per violation
- **Class action risk:** Deceptive practices lawsuits
- **Chargebacks:** Angry customers dispute charges
- **Refund costs:** Must refund deceptive charges
- **Brand damage:** Reputation destroyed by bad press

**Ethical Business:**
Good CRO increases conversion through trust and value, 
NOT through deception. Dark patterns may boost short-term 
metrics but destroy long-term business.

**Recommendation:**
❌ **BLOCK IMMEDIATELY** - Legal compliance issue
⚖️ **Legal review required**
🔄 **Redesign with transparent UX**
