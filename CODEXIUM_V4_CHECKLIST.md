# Codexium V4 Project Checklist

## System Components and Features

- [x] Orchestrator: Responsible for managing the workflow and interactions between system components.
- [x] Neo Reviews: Automated code review tool integrated into the system.
- [x] Decision Engine: Analyzes data and makes decisions based on predefined criteria.
- [x] Auto-Labeling: Automatically labels issues and pull requests based on content analysis.
- [x] Merge Gate: Ensures that only code that meets certain criteria is merged into the main branch. Note: Integration with branch protection may need verification.
- [ ] Persistence Layer: Stores and manages data for long-term access and analysis. Currently not implemented.
- [x] Operational Safety: Measures and protocols in place to ensure system reliability and data integrity. Implementation is partial.

## Completion Status

Given the above components and their current state, the completion percentages for each category are:

- Core Functionality: 80% (4 out of 5 key components are fully operational)
- Integration & Safety: 50% (1 out of 2 key aspects are partially implemented)

Overall, considering the weights of core functionality (70%) and integration & safety (30%) in the project's completion metric, the total completion percentage is calculated as follows:

Total Completion = (Core Functionality Completion * 0.7) + (Integration & Safety Completion * 0.3)
                 = (80% * 0.7) + (50% * 0.3)
                 = 56% + 15%
                 = 71%

Therefore, the current total completion percentage of the Codexium V4 project is approximately 71%.
