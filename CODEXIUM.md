## Tech Stack
- React 18
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

## Coding Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Export default for components
- Place components in src/components/
- Tests in *.test.tsx files
- Use Tailwind utility classes (no custom CSS)

## Component Patterns
- All components should have TypeScript props interface
- Include PropTypes for runtime validation
- Add data-testid attributes for testing
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns

## Testing Requirements
- Every component must have tests
- Test user interactions
- Test edge cases
